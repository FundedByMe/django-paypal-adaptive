Django Paypal Adaptive
===

This is not a stable repository. The API and the modules will be subject to
heavy changes and not all Paypal Adaptive endpoints are covered. FundedByMe
will help make the covering of the Pay, Preapproval and IPN endpoints as good
as possible but we might not have the resources to perfect this project.

Making Preapprovals and using them to create Payments is fully supported and
tested as long as IPN is turned on. Creating Payments without Preapprovals
might not work in this version.

Please reach out to us if you're interested in helping maintaining this
package.

Settings

TEST_WITH_MOCK

Set whether tests should be run with built-in mocking responses and requests
or if the testing should spawn requests that hits Paypal's APIs directly.
Defaults to True. Override in your settings file like this:
