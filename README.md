We are no longer using PayPal at FundedByMe do to terrible customer service and techincal issues with PayPal. We have now moved to Mangopal and are maintaining django-mangopay a django wrapper for their API. If you are interesting is becoming the offical maintainer of this library please let us know.

Django Paypal Adaptive
======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FundedByMe/django-paypal-adaptive.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FundedByMe/django-paypal-adaptive)
[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-paypal-adaptive.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-paypal-adaptive)

The API and the modules in this repository might be subject to smaller
changes and not all Paypal Adaptive endpoints are covered. FundedByMe
will help make the covering of the Pay, Preapproval and IPN endpoints as good
as possible but we might not have the resources to perfect this project.

Making Preapprovals and using them to create Payments is fully supported
together with Paypal's IPN push API. Please reach out to us if you're
interested in helping maintaining this package.

Installation
============

Install package from PyPI:

    $ pip install django-paypal-adaptive
    
Add to your project's `INSTALLED_APPS` setting:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # …
    'paypaladaptive',
)
```

Sync the database:
    
    $ python manage.py syncdb
    
Or if you're using __South__ you might want to add an initial migration for future changes:
    
    $ python manage.py schemamigration paypaladaptive --initial
    $ python manage.py syncdb --migrate


Usage
=====

Examples
--------

Create and process a preapproval for a payment.

```python
from paypaladaptive.models import Preapproval
from money.Money import Money

preapproval = Preapproval()
preapproval.money = Money(2000, 'usd')
preapproval.save()
preapproval.process(next='/home/', displayMaxTotalAmount=True)

# Redirect the user to the next_url() value
redirect_url = preapproval.next_url()
```

Create and process a payment to two receivers from a preapproval key.

```python
from paypaladaptive.models import Payment
from paypaladaptive.api import ReceiverList, Receiver
from money.Money import Money

key = 'PA-2MT146200X905683P'
platform = Receiver(amount=100, email="merchant@example.com", primary=False)
merchant = Receiver(amount=1900, email="mrbuyer@antonagestam.se", primary=True)
receivers = ReceiverList([platform, merchant])

p = Payment()
p.money=Money(2000, 'USD')
p.save()
p.process(receivers, preapproval_key=key)
```

IPN vs Delayed Updates
----------------------

Paypal Adaptive uses IPN messages to ping your server about Payment and
Preapproval updates. Using IPN requires you to listen for incoming calls from
Paypal. Sometimes Paypal has issues with their IPN service and therefor you
might sometimes need to ping them for an update of the status instead. This
package comes with both and they can be used in parallel. That way you get both
the speed and asynchronous nature of IPN messages and the stability of delayed
lookups. Delayed lookups are disabled by default and requires Celery to be
installed. To install this requirement automatically, use:

    $ pip install django-paypal-adaptive[delayed-updates]

And set `PAYPAL_USE_DELAYED_UPDATES` to `True` in your Django settings. Note
that this requires you to setup Celery on your own.

You can also implement your own background tasks and logic and call
`Preapproval.update()` and `Payment.update()` when you find it appropriate.

Models
======

The Payment and Preapproval inherit from an abstract model PaypalAdaptive and
therefor shares some data fields.

__`PaypalAdaptive.money`__

`money` is a python-money MoneyField. MoneyField extends Django's DecimalField
so has max_digits and decimal_places attributes that can be set with the
`PAYPAL_MAX_DIGITS` and `PAYPAL_DECIMAL_PLACES` settings.

__`PaypalAdaptive.created_date`__

DateTimeField with `auto_now_add=True`.

__`PaypalAdaptive.debug_request`__

Raw request body (JSON)

__`PaypalAdaptive.debug_response`__

Raw response body (JSON)

__`PaypalAdaptive.secret_uuid`__

Secret identifier of each object.

Payment
-------

__`Payment.status`__

Possible values are:

    'new'  # Payment only exists locally
    'created'  # Payment exists on Paypal
    'error'  # Something along the process has gone wrong. Check status_detail
             # for more info.
    'returned'  # User has returned via the Payment return_url
    'completed'  # The Payment is complete
    'refunded'  # The Payment is refunded
    'canceled'  # The Payment has been canceled

__`Payment.status_detail`__

Stores error messages from the latest transaction

__`Payment.pay_key`__

Corresponds to Paypal Adaptive's `payKey`

__`Payment.transaction_id`__

Corresponds to Paypal Adaptive's `transactionId`

Preapproval
-----------

__`Preapproval.status`__

Possible values are:

    'new'  # Preapproval only exists locally — not known to Paypal
    'created'  # Preapproval has been saved on Paypal
    'error'  # Something has gone wrong, check status_detail for more info
    'returned'  # User has returned via the Preapproval return_url
    'approved'  # Preapproval is completed — ready to be used in payment
    'canceled'  # Preapproval has been canceled
    'used'  # Preapproval has been used in payment

__`Preapproval.status_detail`__

Stores error messages from the latest transaction

__`Preapproval.valid_until_date`__

Preapproval expiry date
